#openHAB for Kodi

openHAB for Kodi is a frontend to control an openHAB server over a network connection. It implements a lot of elements from the openHAB Classic UI web interface just using the Kodi GUI.

With openHAB for Kodi you can navigate through your openHAB sitemaps, watch all your item's states and set any item state, e.g. boolean switches, dimmers, set-points, colors, etc.

This plugin is a rewrite of the plugin created by Bianco Jean-Fran√ßois, Poustis Rebecca located at http://air.imag.fr/index.php/Extensions_XBMC#Plugin_openHab.

The main window uses technics from the OpenELEC settings addon (https://github.com/OpenELEC/service.openelec.settings).

The color picker dialog uses elements from the Mimic skin for Kodi (https://github.com/bryanbrazil/skin.mimic).
